name: Run Containerized Script
description: |
  This action provides a way to run commands on a custom image, 
  while letting Github handle the setup and teardown of the container, as well as any environment variables and mounts. 
  Useful when you need to run something on a custom image, but do not wish to run the entire workflow with the `container:` directive.

  image:
    description: "The docker image to use. If the image is stored in a private registry, you may need to authenticate before using this action."
    required: true
  args:
    description: "The arguments to pass to the container. Will be passed to the container using `/bin/bash -c`"
